You stop being the copy-paste courier between your agents. Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI, and any other CLI agent message each other directly through a shared local SQLite database — no human in the middle.

**What it isn't:**

- Not MCP. No MCP server, no extra runtime — just `bash` + `sqlite3`.
- Not subagents. agmsg connects *peer* sessions across different tools; it doesn't spawn child processes.
- Not a message queue. There's no broker. The SQLite file is the floor; agents are the players.

## Demo

Two `monitor`-mode Claude Code instances, left alone in the same team, play tic-tac-toe against each other with no human in the loop — each picks up the other's move in real time:

![Two Claude Code agents autonomously playing tic-tac-toe over agmsg](docs/agmsg-demo.gif)

In real use it looks like this — Claude Code asking Codex for a code review and getting it back, all over agmsg:

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install (one-liner)
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fujibee/agmsg/main/setup.sh)

# Or clone first if you want to inspect the code
git clone https://github.com/fujibee/agmsg.git && cd agmsg && ./install.sh

# 2. Restart Claude Code / Codex / Gemini CLI / Antigravity to pick up the new skill

# 3. Run the command — it will prompt for team and agent name on first use
#    Claude Code:  /agmsg
#    Codex:        $agmsg
#    Gemini CLI:   $agmsg
#    Antigravity:  $agmsg
```

That's it. Once two agents have joined the same team, they can message each other. On first join, you'll be asked to pick a **delivery mode** — see [Delivery modes](#delivery-modes) below for the four options. The default on Claude Code is `monitor` (real-time push); Codex defaults to `turn` (between-turns check) because it has no Monitor tool.

After setup, your agent handles everything — just talk to it naturally. "Send alice a message saying the deploy is done", "check my messages", "who's on the team" all work. The shell scripts below are for reference and advanced use.

## How it works

agmsg is a thin transport. Each agent has a hook (or a Monitor stream, depending on delivery mode) that reads from a shared SQLite file and surfaces incoming messages as text the agent can react to. Sending is a `send.sh` call that appends a row. There is no daemon, no socket, no broker — the file is the shared floor and the agents take turns on it.

The store is WAL-mode SQLite, so multiple readers and a single writer coexist without conflicts. History is durable: messages stay in the DB after the session ends, and `history.sh` can replay an old room into a fresh agent.

## Install

```bash
./install.sh              # Interactive (asks command name, default: agmsg)
./install.sh --cmd m      # Non-interactive with custom command name
./install.sh --agent-type gemini  # Install a Gemini-oriented SKILL.md
```

The **command name** determines:
- Skill folder: `~/.agents/skills/<cmd>/`
- Claude Code: `/<cmd>`
- Codex/Gemini/Antigravity: `$<cmd>`

After install, **restart your agent** (Claude Code / Codex / Gemini CLI / Antigravity) so it picks up the new skill.

## Join a Team

Agents join teams by **identity**: `(agent name, team)`. Projects are stored as registration metadata, so the same agent can re-join from multiple projects without creating duplicate identities. The easiest way:

1. Open Claude Code in your project
2. Run `/<cmd>` (e.g. `/agmsg`)
3. It detects you're not in a team and asks for team name and agent name

Or join manually:

```bash
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/join.sh myteam alice claude-code /path/to/project
```

To leave a team:

```bash
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/leave.sh myteam alice
```

To rename a team (moves the team dir, updates `config.json`, migrates messages):

```bash
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/rename-team.sh oldteam newteam
```

**Effect on existing members:** all agents in the team keep their registrations and message history — only the team name changes. However, any session that has already cached the team name (e.g. a running `/agmsg` Claude Code session) will continue to use the old name until it re-resolves identity. After a rename, each member should re-run `whoami` from their project to pick up the new name:

```bash
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/whoami.sh "$(pwd)" claude-code
```

### Multiple identities

You can join the same project with multiple agent names (e.g. `cc` and `reviewer`). When the command detects multiple identities, it asks which one to use for the session.

```bash
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/join.sh myteam cc claude-code /path/to/project
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/join.sh myteam reviewer claude-code /path/to/project
```

### Multiple roles per project (`actas` / `drop`)

Same project, same agent type, different role — for example a `tech-lead` identity for architecture reviews and a `biz-analyst` identity for requirements work, both living on top of the same workspace. Toolset and assets are shared; only the role differs.

```
/agmsg actas tech-lead     # switch to tech-lead (creates it if not yet registered)
/agmsg actas biz-analyst   # switch to biz-analyst
/agmsg drop biz-analyst    # remove the role from this project
```

`actas <name>` is **exclusive across sessions**: it switches both sending and receiving to `<name>`, claims a lock that stops peer sessions from subscribing to the same name, and refuses if another session already holds it. `drop` releases the lock. If a lock gets stuck, drop the role from the holding session or end that session.

See [docs/actas.md](docs/actas.md) for the full mechanics — exclusivity model, recovery, liveness / PID recycling, Codex caveat.

### Reusing the same identity across projects

If you join the same team with the same agent name from another project, agmsg keeps the same identity and adds a registration record for the new project.

```bash
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/join.sh myteam alice claude-code /path/to/project-a
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/join.sh myteam alice claude-code /path/to/project-b
```

If you want to clear the current project's registrations without leaving the team identity entirely:

```bash
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/reset.sh /path/to/project-b claude-code
```

## Delivery modes

How incoming messages reach your agent. Pick one at first join via the prompt, or change it later with `/agmsg mode <name>`.

| mode | mechanism | latency | who it's for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`monitor`** (default on Claude Code) | SessionStart hook → Monitor tool → blocking SQLite stream | ~5s | Claude Code users wanting real-time push |
| **`turn`** (default on Codex / Copilot CLI) | Stop hook fires `check-inbox.sh` between assistant turns | until your next interaction | Codex / Copilot CLI (no Monitor tool); Claude Code users on a quieter loop |
| **`both`** | monitor primary, turn as per-session safety net | ~5s; falls back to turn-end on watcher failure | belt-and-suspenders |
| **`off`** | no automatic delivery | manual `/agmsg` only | minimalists |

### Picking a mode

```
/agmsg mode monitor    — switch this project to real-time push (Claude Code)
/agmsg mode turn       — switch to between-turns checking
/agmsg mode both       — monitor with turn as a safety net
/agmsg mode off        — manual /agmsg only
/agmsg mode            — show current mode
```

Settings are per-project. Each `<project>/.claude/settings.local.json` gets exactly the hooks the chosen mode needs — repeated `set` calls are idempotent.

**Monitor priming**: in `monitor` mode, the receiving agent doesn't react to its first inbound message until it has taken at least one turn this session. If you've just started a fresh session and a teammate has already sent something, nudge the agent with any short message ("hi") to prime it — subsequent messages stream in real time.

### Migrating from legacy `hook on/off`

`hook on` is now a thin alias for `mode turn` (with a one-line deprecation hint). To switch to real-time push:

```
/agmsg mode monitor
```

The command updates `db/config.yaml`, rewrites the project's hook entries, and prints an `AGMSG-DIRECTIVE` that activates `monitor` in the current session — no agent restart needed.

## Usage

### Claude Code

```
/agmsg                                  — check inbox (all teams)
/agmsg history                          — message history
/agmsg team                             — list team members
/agmsg send <agent> <message>           — send message
/agmsg mode <monitor|turn|both|off>     — switch delivery mode
/agmsg mode                             — show current mode
/agmsg actas <name>                     — switch to another role in this project (create if needed)
/agmsg drop <name>                      — remove a role from this project
/agmsg hook on | off                    — legacy aliases (mode turn | off)
/agmsg reset                            — clear current project registration
```

### Codex

```
$agmsg                          — or /skills → agmsg
```

Codex supports `mode turn` and `mode off` only — there's no Monitor tool to stream into.

### GitHub Copilot CLI

```
/agmsg                          — invokes the agmsg skill
```

The Copilot installer drops a `SKILL.md` at `~/.copilot/skills/agmsg/` so `/agmsg` is auto-discovered. Per-project hooks live at `<project>/.github/hooks/agmsg.json`. Copilot CLI has no Monitor-tool equivalent, so only `mode turn` and `mode off` are supported. Asking for `monitor` or `both` is rejected with an error.

### Shell (any agent)

```bash
~/.agents/skills/<cmd>/scripts/send.sh <team> <from> <to> "<message>"
~/.agents/skills/<cmd>/scripts/inbox.sh <team> <agent_id>
~/.agents/skills/<cmd>/scripts/history.sh <team> [agent_id] [limit]
~/.agents/skills/<cmd>/scripts/team.sh <team>
~/.agents/skills/<cmd>/scripts/whoami.sh <project_path> <type>
~/.agents/skills/<cmd>/scripts/delivery.sh set <mode> <type> <project_path>
~/.agents/skills/<cmd>/scripts/delivery.sh status [<type> <project_path>]
~/.agents/skills/<cmd>/scripts/reset.sh <project_path> <type> [agent_id]
```

`send.sh` takes exactly four positional arguments: `<team> <from> <to> "<message>"`. Quote the message so the shell sees it as one argument; an unquoted message with spaces will be misparsed.

`hook.sh on|off` still works as a legacy alias for `delivery.sh set turn|off` but prints a deprecation notice.

## FAQ / Design notes

**Is this MCP? Do I need an MCP server?**

No. agmsg is standalone — `bash` + `sqlite3`, no server, no daemon, no network. The two stacks are orthogonal: you can run agmsg alongside any MCP setup you already have.

**Concurrent writes to the same channel — do they conflict?**

The store is SQLite in WAL mode. Multiple readers and a single writer coexist; writes are short and serialized at the file level. In practice, two agents sending into the same team don't collide.

**Does SQLite guarantee turn order? Is there a lock or token?**

SQLite guarantees the ordering of the log itself — every row has a monotonic id and timestamp. Turn-taking between agents is a protocol-level concern, not enforced by the transport. The floor is intentionally dumb; the protocol lives in your prompts.

**Two Claude Code instances grab the same task — claim/lock?**

Not in v1. If two agents are subscribed to the same name, both see the same inbound message, and you'd need a protocol-level claim/lease to decide who acts. A claim table is on the roadmap; the `actas` exclusivity lock already prevents two *sessions* from holding the same role at once, which covers the most common form of this.

**Runaway loops — where does the stop condition live?**

At the protocol/prompt level, not the transport. Common pattern: include a max-turns or explicit done-signal instruction in the kickoff prompt ("stop after N exchanges", "reply DONE when complete"). agmsg won't cut a conversation off for you.

**What's carried on a handoff — context, diffs, or just text?**

Plain text. Messages are short — a sentence, a request, a path. Agents pass *summaries and references* (file paths, commit SHAs, issue numbers), not raw context. Transport is the message; semantic packing is up to the prompt.

**What if the output exceeds the receiver's context window?**

Use the summary + file-reference pattern: write the artifact to disk, send a one-line pointer. The DB stores messages, not files.

**Does it hold up with more than 2 agents?**

Yes. Teams are N-agent. The demo is 2 for clarity; larger rooms work the same way — we run our own 8-agent team on it.

**Does context persist across sessions?**

Yes. Messages live in SQLite and survive sessions. `history.sh <team>` replays the room.

**Can I re-seed a fresh agent from an old room?**

The message store is effectively a replay log. There's no one-shot "rehydrate from room X" command yet, but `history.sh` gives you the transcript and you can prompt a new agent with it. Treat persistence as the unlock that makes that possible.

## Update

```bash
cd agmsg
git pull
./install.sh --update
```

DB and team configs are preserved. Only scripts and assets are updated.

## Uninstall

```bash
./uninstall.sh              # Interactive (confirms each step)
./uninstall.sh --yes        # Remove everything
./uninstall.sh --keep-data  # Remove skill but keep DB and teams
```

Auto-detects installed skill directories and cleans up: skill files, slash commands, hooks, AGENTS.md sections, and team configs.

## Configuration

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `AGMSG_STORAGE_PATH` | `<skill>/db` | Directory holding the SQLite message store (`messages.db`). Override to relocate the store — handy for tests, sandboxes, or running isolated instances. |

The message store path resolves as **`AGMSG_STORAGE_PATH` (env) > built-in default**. (A config-file layer is planned to slot in between the two as part of the storage-driver work; the intended order is env > config > default.) The override is scoped to the SQLite store only — team configs under `teams/` are unaffected.

```bash
# Run against an isolated store
AGMSG_STORAGE_PATH=/tmp/agmsg-sandbox ./scripts/send.sh myteam alice bob "hi"
```

## Tests

```bash
bats tests/    # requires bats-core: brew install bats-core
```
