# against "1" and fails even when the script under test wrote a correct file.

# empty, so the surrounding json_extract / json_valid sees nothing and the check
# fails even though the script under test wrote a correct file. cygpath -w
# converts it; a no-op off Windows (cygpath absent). The result is then single-
