# Stream new agmsg messages for the current session as they arrive.
#
# Intended to be launched by Claude Code's Monitor tool from the SessionStart
# hook (`session-start.sh`), but also works standalone as `tail -f` for
# inbox: any agent runtime that can read stdout can consume it.
#
# Usage: watch.sh <session_id> <project_path> <agent_type> [active_name]
#
# Behavior:
#   - Resolves (team, agent) pairs for (project_path, agent_type) via
#     identities.sh. By default, subscribes to messages addressed to any
#     of those pairs.
#   - When [active_name] is given, narrows the subscription to only pairs
#     whose agent name matches — useful for `actas` exclusive role mode.
#   - A fresh session sets the high-water mark to the current MAX(id) at
#     startup, so the stream begins with whatever arrives after launch — no
#     replay of historical messages. The mark is persisted per session_id, so
#     a restart of this session's watcher (actas/drop/clear/self-restart)
#     resumes from the last delivered id and does not drop messages that
#     arrived during the restart gap. See #107.
#   - Polls the SQLite DB at AGMSG_WATCH_INTERVAL seconds (default 5, also
#     overridable via the delivery.monitor.poll_interval config key).
#   - Emits one line per new message:
#         <ts> | <team> | <from> → <to> | <body>
#     Newlines in body are escaped to literal "\n" so each message stays a
#     single line — easier for Monitor to deliver as one event.
#   - Writes a pidfile at ~/.agents/agmsg/run/watch.<session_id>.pid and
#     removes it on EXIT / SIGTERM / SIGINT.
