# and the built-in default once the storage-driver work lands; the intended
# full order is env > config > default. Keep that logic here so call sites
# stay unchanged.

# Run sqlite3 against the message store with a busy_timeout, so a writer that
# finds the DB locked WAITS for it instead of failing immediately with
# SQLITE_BUSY. WAL (set at init) lets readers and a single writer coexist, but
# concurrent writers still serialize; with the default busy_timeout=0 a leader
# fanning a job out to N members would lose all but one write — and silently,
# since the failed sends just exit non-zero. All DB-backed call sites go through
# this wrapper. In-memory JSON parsing (`sqlite3 :memory:`) does not need it —
# it has no file lock to contend for. Override the timeout via
# $AGMSG_BUSY_TIMEOUT (milliseconds). See #114.
#
# Uses the `.timeout` dot-command rather than `PRAGMA busy_timeout=N`: the
# PRAGMA returns its value as a row, which sqlite3 would print to stdout and
# corrupt every SELECT's output (and the watch stream). `.timeout` sets the
# same busy timeout silently.
# sqlite3 >= 3.50 renders control bytes in CLI output using caret notation —
# the char(31) record separator becomes the two literal chars "^_", and a CR
# becomes "^M". That breaks the `IFS=$'\x1f' read` field splitting in
# inbox/check-inbox/history and the monitor watch stream (#102), the same
# sqlite3 >= 3.50 escaping behaviour behind #143. `-escape off` restores the
# raw bytes. Older sqlite3 (< 3.50) doesn't know the option (and emits raw bytes
# anyway), so probe once and only pass the flag when the build accepts it.
